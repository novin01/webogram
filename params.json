It is based on the [MTProto protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) and has an [Open API](https://core.telegram.org/api). I personally like Telegram for its speed and cloud-support (that makes a web app possible, unlike in the case of WA and others).\r\n\r\nMTProto data can be carried over HTTP (SSL is also supported), so this project is my take at creating one.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm using this app myself and I'd like to share its sources, so anyone can contribute to the development. Any help is welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Interface\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshots of the interface:\r\n\r\n\r\n![Sample screenshot 1](/app/img/screenshot1.png)\r\n![Mobile screenshot 2](/app/img/screenshot2.png)\r\n![Mobile screenshot 3](/app/img/screenshot3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Unsupported at the moment\r\n\r\n* Secret chats\r\n* Black list\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Maintained locations\r\n\r\n\r\n| Description        | URL           | Type  |\r\n| ------------- |-------------| -----:|\r\n| Online Web-version (hosted on Telegram servers)      | https://web.telegram.org/ | hosted\r\n| Online Web-version (hosted on GitHub pages)      | https://zhukov.github.io/webogram | hosted\r\n| Chrome Web Store      | [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram/ clhhggbfdinjmjhajaheehoeibfljjno](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram/clhhggbfdinjmjhajaheehoeibfljjno) |   packed\r\n| Firefox & FirefoxOS Marketplace | https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/telegram |    packed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Hosted version**: the app is downloaded via HTTPS as a usual website. Will be available offline due to application cache.\r\n\r\n**Packed version**: the app is downloaded at once in a package via HTTPS. The package is updated less frequently than the Web-version.\r\n\r\nAll of the apps above are submitted and maintained by [@zhukov](https://github.com/zhukov), so feel free to use them and report bugs [here](https://github.com/zhukov/webogram/issues). Please do not report bugs which are only reproducible in different locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical details\r\n\r\nThe app is based on the AngularJS JavaScript framework, and written in pure JavaScript. jQuery is used for DOM manipulations, and Bootstrap as the CSS-framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running locally\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project repository is based on angularjs-seed and includes gulp tasks, so it's easy to launch the app locally on your desktop.\r\nInstall [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and run the following commands in the project directory\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo npm install -g gulp\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will install all the needed dependencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Running web-server\r\n\r\n\r\nJust run `gulp watch` to start the web server and the livereload task.\r\nOpen http://localhost:8000/app/index.html in your browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Running as Chrome Packaged App\r\n\r\nTo run this application in Google Chrome as a packaged app, open this URL (in Chrome): `chrome://extensions/`, then tick \"Developer mode\" and press \"Load unpacked extension...\". Select the downloaded `app` folder and Webogram should appear in the list.\r\n\r\nRun `gulp watch` to watch for file changes and automatically rebuild the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Running as Firefox OS App\r\n\r\nTo run this application in Firefox as a packaged app, open \"Menu\" -> \"Developer\" -> \"WebIDE\" (or hit `Shift + F8`). Choose \"Open packaged app\" from the Project menu and select the `app` folder.\r\n\r\nRun `gulp watch` to watch for file changes and automatically rebuild the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Third party libraries\r\n\r\nBesides the frameworks mentioned above, other libraries are used for protocol and UI needs. Here is the short list:\r\n\r\n* [JSBN](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/jsbn/)\r\n* [CryptoJS](https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/)\r\n* [zlib.js](https://github.com/imaya/zlib.js)\r\n* [UI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)\r\n* [jQuery Emojiarea](https://github.com/diy/jquery-emojiarea)\r\n* [nanoScrollerJS](https://github.com/jamesflorentino/nanoScrollerJS)\r\n* [gemoji](https://github.com/github/gemoji)\r\n* [emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data)\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all these libraries' authors and contributors.
